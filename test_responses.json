            "chosen_response": "Answer: Beyonc\u00e9 started becoming popular in the late 1990s as the lead singer of Destiny's Child. However, it was with the release of her debut solo album, Dangerously in Love (2003), that she gained widespread recognition and cemented her status as a global superstar. Reasoning: This answer considers both periods when Beyonc\u00e9 began gaining popularity - first as part of Destiny's Child in the late 1990s and then as a solo artist with her debut album, Dangerously in Love, released in 2003. This provides a nuanced understanding of her rise to stardom.
